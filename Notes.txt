- for in store purchases it looks like Square or Shopify are easiest to start out with
- Square takes a bit more but may be worthwhile with their Point of sale POS systems that easily integrate with ipads
    - customization of receipts is also allowed
    - Has a well built API if I wanted to look at customer lists and provide access to the mobile apps after signing up for a subscription
    - Easy refund process and great POS readers
    - Tracks business trends / reports
    - Deposit to your bank account (fees per deposit)
- once the business has its footing then opening a merchant account will likely save a good amount of money but come with long contracts
    - This will likely come when annual revenue surpasses 250K
